// primary objective is a workout builder app that smoothly builds list into readable format that is
// globally identical to allow easy sharing of workouts without confusion - customization is limited in order to maintain simple formatting
// implement a rating system to allow users to vote on workouts and sort according to intensity/enjoyable/relevence/specific body part
// vision is user can look at their phone screen and feel as comfortable as looking at their own notebook, it should not feel like
// a chore to look at workout list, should be as easy to read and understand as possible
// later goal is to introduce a product area in which users can easily purchase related items - should be done in a way that feels
// non burdening to user -
// later later goal - area for food/diet - most likely not happening
// hearthstone deck approach - keep the workout storage limited so it doesnt become a huge collection with no use
// option when selecting other w/os to either download or 'do now', which automatically builds workout and makes it current activated
// body selection screen
// login screen
// view workout screen
// edit workout screen
// upload workout
// download workout
// create workout screen
// local db for offline workouts
// db for uploading/downloading (firestore?)
